            <h2>Who we are</h2>
            <p>Our team so far consists of only one person, me, Vangelis. I am a beginner full-stack developer who has taken the Coding Factory bootcamp training and acquired a wide array of skills to use in developing front-ends, back-ends and databases.</p>

            <h3>Our goals for the future</h3>
            <p>I am hoping to apply my skills to practical use by developing material, with a view to honing my skills and increase the efficiency with which I work. I feel excited about all that is to come and I invite you to participate in this effort by further exploring our work so far:</p>
